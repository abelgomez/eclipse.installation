# Eclipse Papyrus MARTE Installation Scripts

Installation scripts to install Eclipse SDK, Papyrus, and the MARTE profile.

**IMPORTANT**: These scripts assume the main script files (`_install-eclipse-linux.sh`, `_install-eclipse-windows.ps1` and `_install-eclipse-macosx.command`) are in the parent folder. If you move the scripts in this folder, update the paths accordingly.
